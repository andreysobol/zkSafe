## Aggregated Zero Knowledge Multisig on EVM blockchains

Using multisig in EVM blockchains, there is a trade-off between security (the number of signatures) and gas cost. The more signatures, the more expensive the transactions. If we introduce waiting time into this equation, there will be a trilemma - time, the number of signatures, and gas usage.

Thanks to the use of ZK technologies, it is possible to create batches of multisig transactions with a low transaction cost and a high number of signatures (and thus a higher level of security). However, we will sacrifice waiting time.

# Gas efficiency

On a batch of 50 transactions our zkSafe contract will be 2.5 times cheaper than single signature EOA ERC20 transfer. Compared to the Gnosis Safe, our contract will be 5 times cheaper.

Using batch of 6 transactions our zkSafe contract become more efficient than Gnosis Safe. Using batch of 14 transactions our zkSafe contract become more efficient than EOA ERC20 transfer.

# UX flow

User can deposit money to our contract using `deposit` method. He provide `multisig_id` - pedersen hash of `n`, `m` and `public_keys`. `m` - size of all participants, `n` - number of signatures required to execute transaction.

When user want to make a transaction, he sign `operation` message. `operation` message contain `amount`, `token` and `to` address. User send aggregated signature to operator.

Operator combine signatures from different users and generate zk proof. Operator send proof to contract calling method `execute`.

Operator can't steal money, because he can't create valid signature without private keys of participants. So protocol is secure and totally trustless.

# GPT-3 joke

prompt: 

*ChatGPT please write funny joke about Aggregated Zero Knowledge Multisig on EVM blockchains*

response:

*Why did the Aggregated Zero Knowledge Multisig contract become a stand-up comedian on the EVM blockchain?*

*Because it realized that even in the world of decentralized finance, a good laugh is the best way to cope with those gas fees that just keep multiplying! ðŸ˜„ðŸ’¸*

# Build circuit

Build circom:

```
cd /tmp
git clone https://github.com/iden3/circom.git
cargo build --release
cargo install --path circom
```

Install dependencies for circuit:


```
cd circuits
npm install
```

Build circuit:

```
circom multisig.circom --r1cs --wasm --sym --c
```

# Trusted setup

```
cd prover
npm install
```

First, we start a new "powers of tau" trusted setup ceremony, size: 2**20

```
snarkjs powersoftau new bn128 20 pot20_0000.ptau -v
```

First contribution to the ceremony

```
snarkjs powersoftau contribute pot20_0000.ptau pot20_0001.ptau --name="First contribution" -v
```

Prepare circuit specific phase2. Finalize the ceremony

```
snarkjs powersoftau prepare phase2 pot20_0001.ptau pot20_final.ptau -v
```

Export verification key

```
snarkjs groth16 setup ../circuits/src/multisig.r1cs pot20_final.ptau multisig.zkey
```

Generate solidity verifier

```
snarkjs zkey export solidityverifier multisig.zkey ../contracts/src/Verifier.sol
```
